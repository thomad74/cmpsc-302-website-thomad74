The first host we are going to meet is Dillon Thoma. Dillon, is a junior at Allegheny
College studying Computer Science and Economics. He also plays for the Varsity Men's
Soccer team, and is a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity where he is a two-time
New Member Educator. In typical Chill JamZ fashion, a few fun facts about Dillon
are that his favorite television show is Game of Thrones, his favorite food is
Chipotle, and he is missing an organ! Dillon has been a full-time host for 2 years
now, and was a part-time host before that. His favorite part about the show is
"spending time with my best friends and laughing at the things we come up with
each week". Tune in each week to hear DJ Fingerma on the sticks!

The second host we are going to meet is Eddie Opalko. Eddie, more formerly known
as E-Money or DJ EJ, is also a junior at Allegheny College studying Physics and
Economics. He is also a member of the Varsity Men's Soccer team, and a brother
of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity where he is the Vice President. A few fun facts about
Eddie include his diet consists of strictly foods and drinks that begin with the
letter "P", his favorite bird is a pigeon, and he is a die hard Arsenal fan. Eddie
has been a full-time host for 2 years, and hopes to continue his hard work into senior year.

The third host goes by the alias "Intern Ben", and thinks his DJ name is Baby Swiss.
Ben Watto is a junior at Allegheny College studying Computer Science and Economics.
He is also a brother of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, where he serves as the Academics
Chair. Ben is the treasurer of a computer science club on campus called ACM, where
he manages the funds for the club and pays for events. Some fun facts about Ben
are that his favorite skin on Fortnite is Verge, his favorite color is red, and
his favorite candy is Reese's, even though he thinks he is slightly allergic to
nuts. Ben has been an intern host with the show for the past two years, the longest
serving intern in WARC history. There is no promotion in sight for Ben, but he is
a valuable piece of the puzzle that is Chill JamZ.
