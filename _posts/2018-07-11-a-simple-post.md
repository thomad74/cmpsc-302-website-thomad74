The first host we are going to meet is Dillon Thoma. Dillon is a junior at Allegheny
College studying Computer Science and Economics. He also plays for the Varsity Men's
Soccer team, and is a member of Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. In typical Chill JamZ
fashion, a few fun facts about Dillon are that his favorite television show is Game
of Thrones, his favorite food is Chipotle, and he is missing an organ! Dillon has
been a full-time host for 2 years now, and was a part-time host before that. His
favorite part about the show is "spending time with my best friends and laughing
at the things we come up with each week".
