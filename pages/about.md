  Chill JamZ is a radio talkshow that provides humorous segments about the happenings at Allegheny College. Additionally, our hosts play music that can be listened to while doing homework, trying to fall asleep, or just relax; hence the name 'Chill JamZ'.

Chill JamZ airs on Tuesday mornings at midnight, and last until about 1 am.

### Show Breakdown

Our basic breakdown of each show starts by us introducing ourselves and discussing a little bit about the show. Next, we dive into some WARC analytics to see who is tuning in this week. We follow this up with some songs, and once those are complete, we jump into everyone's favorite segment: IM Sports Weekly Roundup. We will play more songs at this point, and then move to some shoutouts and fun facts. After another song, we will provide the listeners with a detailed weather report for the following day. Following this, we will play a couple of songs and move into our final segment of the show, which varies from show to show! After a couple more songs, we will sign off and finish the show with some final Chill JamZ.

#### Hosts

We have three hosts that run the show at Chill JamZ. First is DJ Fingerma, who is a grizzled veteran on the sound board. Next we have E-Money, who is the brains behind the operation. Last and certainly least is Intern Ben, who is supposed to do the rest of the 'grunt work' but really is just there to pick fun at. We would like to remember our fourth member, T-Mobile, who has resigned from his position due to personal reasons. We will be hosting tryouts for a fourth member in the near future.
